# BPMN in Color Specification

The BPMN in Color Specification has been adopted by the members of the [OMG BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (BPMN MIWG)](http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg/) in 2014 as the recommended way to interchange colors among BPMN modeling tools. It is also used in the official reference models of the [BPMN MIWG Test Suite](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite).

This repository contains the following files:

- [The specification](./BPMN%20in%20COLOR.pdf)
- [The XSD schema](./BPMN%20in%20Color.xsd)
- [A sample BPMN file with colors](./BPMN%20In%20Color%20Sample.bpmn)
